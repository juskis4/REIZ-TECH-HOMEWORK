Java supermarket store

## My thoughts on this small project
In general, it was all smooth an easy to complete. It was a fun little exercise to make, since I haven't made any concole applications in a while. I have spent the most thinking on the method in CashRegister that calculates the change. I knew how to make it, but I was trying to figure out the most efficient way.

The Cash register and Product Storage have hardcoded values put to them in their constructors.
